<h1 id="ab">ABOUT</h1>
<br>
<p>Self-taught, loves to learn and develop, independent, has a high work ethic. Curious and inquisitive.</p>
<p>I was self-employed in the field of events and flower arranging.
Following the covid, I had to leave the field and look for another job.
For the past two years I have been working in a construction company in the purchasing department.
I really like my job, but I also like to chalenge myself.</p>
<p><b>It's time to change careers.</b><br>
I was looking for a profession that suited my personality and skills - I found that the QA role suits me in many ways: I have the ability to pay attention to details, see the object in "3D" and examine it in several aspects.</p>
<p>I am very ambitious and believe that very soon you will find that I am suitable for you.</p>
